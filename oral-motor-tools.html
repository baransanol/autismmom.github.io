<p>The more socially acceptable form of oral motor tools.  I’ll post several options and brands.  These are great to send with kids to school so they are less obtrusive.</p>

<iframe style="width: 120px; height: 240px;" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=autmom-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as4&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=ss_til&amp;asins=B0052ZY8VU" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" width="320" height="240"></iframe>

<h2 id="so-many-options">So Many Options</h2>

<p>I only named a few of the options and brands out there just for developing the jaw and offering sensory input.  There are many other oral motor tools out there to improve muscle tone in the jaw (one example is the use of straws) or offer practice using the mouth appropriately (blowing bubbles, using whistles etc.)  To find other appropriate oral motor tools speak with a speech pathologist or an OT.  Both are knowledgeable and can offer wonderful suggestions tailored to your child’s individual needs.  One of my favorite speech therapy sites, where you can buy some of the above mentioned tools is <a href="http://www.talktools.com/search.php?search_query=Oral+Motor+Tools&amp;gclid=CKWV2q-637MCFQpgMgodxzEA6g" title="Talk Tools">Talk Tools</a>.</p>

<p>As far as chewy tools go, there are many options available for children.  The options range from totally functional (and looking functional) to disguised tools that are more socially acceptable among older children. With so many options out there we can make sure our kids are happy, healthy and getting the sensory input they need.</p>

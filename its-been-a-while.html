<p>I always thought writer’s block was one of those things that writers could get over after an hour or two of thought.  A little break and a little coffee would help the brain come up with new ideas.  This method of getting past writer’s block always worked when I was writing for college courses or other assignments.  Keeping up the momentum for writing about one subject, and a very personal subject at that, has made writing become more of a chore than something to look forward to.</p>

<p>This month I had so much to do that I didn’t really have a chance to even brainstorm topics to write about.  This has been both a blessing and a curse.  It was nice to just be in the moment with my kids without feeling like I had to find the ‘glimmer’ or ‘sparkle’ I could work into a blog post.  Sometimes there just isn’t anything there.  Sometimes there is the moment, and then it passes forever lost in the recesses of the minds of whomever holds the memory close to their heart.  Then sometimes there is something in the moment that is worth sharing but telling it all seems to water it down. Many moments were more than I wanted to publish on the internet because they were too close to my heart.</p>

<p>Writer’s block this month has been more than just the conventional ‘getting past the mental wall.’   It has been a month of figuring out what is closest to my heart and what I feel comfortable sharing with the world.  This month, the writing output was far less than I hoped mostly because what I had to share was just too much.</p>
